#  Understanding Madrid’s pollution levels during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain.
- Studied NO2 levels across all air quality control stations in Madrid city. 
- Used weather and temporal data to study the impact of each variable in NO2 levels.
- Used spatialisation of stations to observe differences and patterns.
- Built a linear model for each station, month and day of the week that predicted NO2 levels (RMSE ~ 5.93 µg/m3)
- Detected stations with a higher impact because of lockdown. Stations in the north of Madrid were more affected than station in the south. The highest impact was observed in the station located at Madrid's airport, and the lowest impact in the station located at Villa de Vallecas. 
- The average impact detected was a reduction in NO2 levels of 46%. 
- The results of this project could be used to improve Madrid's air quality by looking at the effect of mobility restrictions around the area of each station.
